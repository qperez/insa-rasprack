# INSA Rasprack

### A small and transportable educative rack of machines
INSA Rasprack is a small 10-inch rack (5U) 3D printed and designed for teaching Computer Science. 
It is built using open-source plans and hardware.
This project was born out of the need to have multiple fully manageable machines, each with their own network, 
for teaching DevOps, IoT, and Linux systems. 
This website explains how the INSA Rasprack was created and what materials were required.

INSA Rasprack includes:
* 7 Raspberry Pi 3
* A Wi-Fi router
* A managed VLAN ethernet switch
* A 4-outlet power strip
* A 10-port USB hub

### From an idea to a concrete rack

The idea of INSA Rasprack has ermerged when I (Quentin Perez) see many Raspberry Pi cards sleeping in a 
hardware cabinet.
As a lecturer in Green Computing and a researcher on software energy consumption, it broke my heart to see this 
equipment lying idle and unused. Moreover, the network architecture at INSA Rennes did not allow me to have a 
dedicated network infrastructure for education, which would have given me full autonomy 
in my DevOps and IoT practical labs.
After seeing many "small lab racks" built by systems/network or software engineers using multiple Raspberry Pis, 
I realized there was a real opportunity with these devices. 
With the help of François Pasteau, I set out to build the INSA Rasprack.
